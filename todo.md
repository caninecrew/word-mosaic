Word Mosaic – To-Do List

📦 Project Setup
Initialize Python project structure
Set up version control
Create documentation files
Define project dependencies


🧠 Core Game Logic
Implement 15x15 grid system
Create letter bank with 20 randomized letters based on frequency distributions
Develop word validation system
Implement placement rules:
First word must cross center
All new words must connect to existing mosaic
Ensure all word connections are valid
Create letter distribution algorithm


🎯 Scoring System
Implement base letter values (A=1, B=3, etc.)
Add word length bonuses (5+ letter words gain multipliers)
Create connection bonuses for intersecting words
Add special multiplier tiles (double letter, triple word)
Design end-game scoring (coverage, efficiency, complexity bonuses)


🔁 Game Flow
Handle turn structure
Implement letter replenishment after valid placements
Create game state tracking
Design player feedback system
Implement undo functionality (limited)


✨ Power-Ups & Features
Create shuffle feature
Implement optimal placement hint system
Design special abilities and power-ups


🔚 End Game & Summary
Implement game-over detection (no valid placements + empty bank)
Create final scoring calculation
Design game summary/statistics display
Implement replay option


🧪 Testing
Create unit tests for core game logic
Test scoring system accuracy
Validate word dictionary integration
Test game progression and flow


💻 Optional Future Features
Develop GUI interface
Add dictionary integration
Implement save/load functionality
Create difficulty levels
Add achievements system
Implement time-based challenges
