# Word Mosaic – To-Do List

## 📦 Project Setup
- [X] Initialize Python project structure
- [X] Set up version control
- [ ] Create documentation files - complete this step later
- [ ] Define project dependencies - complete this step later
- [X] Select GUI framework (Tkinter/PyQt/Kivy) - PyQt5

## 🧠 Core Game Logic
- [X] Implement 15x15 grid system
- [X] Create letter bank with 20 randomized letters based on frequency distributions
- [ ] Develop word validation system
- [ ] Implement placement rules:
  - [ ] First word must cross center
  - [ ] All new words must connect to existing mosaic
  - [ ] Ensure all word connections are valid
- [ ] Create letter distribution algorithm

## 🎮 User Interface
- [ ] Design main game board layout
- [ ] Create letter bank display
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop letter placement
- [ ] Design score tracking display
- [ ] Add visual feedback for valid/invalid placements
- [ ] Create game menu and controls

## 🎯 Scoring System
- [ ] Implement base letter values (A=1, B=3, etc.)
- [ ] Add word length bonuses (5+ letter words gain multipliers)
- [ ] Create connection bonuses for intersecting words
- [ ] Add special multiplier tiles (double letter, triple word)
- [ ] Design end-game scoring (coverage, efficiency, complexity bonuses)

## 🔁 Game Flow
- [ ] Handle turn structure
- [ ] Implement letter replenishment after valid placements
- [ ] Create game state tracking
- [ ] Design player feedback system
- [ ] Implement undo functionality (limited)

## ✨ Power-Ups & Features
- [ ] Create shuffle feature
- [ ] Implement optimal placement hint system
- [ ] Design special abilities and power-ups

## 🔚 End Game & Summary
- [ ] Implement game-over detection (no valid placements + empty bank)
- [ ] Create final scoring calculation
- [ ] Design game summary/statistics display
- [ ] Implement replay option

## 🧪 Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for core game logic
- [ ] Test scoring system accuracy
- [ ] Validate word dictionary integration
- [ ] Test game progression and flow
- [ ] Test GUI functionality and responsiveness

## 💻 Optional Future Features
- [ ] Add dictionary integration
- [ ] Implement save/load functionality
- [ ] Create difficulty levels
- [ ] Add achievements system
- [ ] Implement time-based challenges
- [ ] Add animations and visual effects
