# Word Mosaic – To-Do List

## 📦 Project Setup
- [X] Initialize Python project structure
- [X] Set up version control
- [ ] Create documentation files - complete this step later
- [X] Define project dependencies - complete this step later
- [X] Select GUI framework (Tkinter/PyQt/Kivy) - PyQt5

## 🧠 Core Game Logic
- [X] Implement 15x15 grid system
- [X] Create letter bank with 20 randomized letters based on frequency distributions
- [X] Develop word validation system
- [X] Implement placement rules:
  - [X] First word must cross center
  - [X] All new words must connect to existing mosaic
  - [X] Ensure all word connections are valid
- [X] Create letter distribution algorithm - works for this purpose

## 🎮 User Interface
- [X] Design main game board layout
- [X] Create letter bank display
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop letter placement
- [X] Design score tracking display
- [X] Add visual feedback for valid/invalid placements
- [X] Create game menu and controls

## 🎯 Scoring System
- [X] Implement base letter values (A=1, B=3, etc.)
- [X] Add word length bonuses (5+ letter words gain multipliers)
- [X] Create connection bonuses for intersecting words
- [X] Add special multiplier tiles (double letter, triple word)
- [ ] Design end-game scoring (coverage, efficiency, complexity bonuses)

## 🔁 Game Flow
- [X] Handle turn structure
- [X] Implement letter replenishment after valid placements
- [X] Create game state tracking
- [X] Design player feedback system

## ✨ Power-Ups & Features
- [X] Create shuffle feature
- [ ] Implement optimal placement hint system
- [ ] Design special abilities and power-ups

## 🔚 End Game & Summary
- [ ] Implement game-over detection (no valid placements + empty bank)
- [X] Create final scoring calculation
- [ ] Design game summary/statistics display
- [ ] Implement replay option

## 🧪 Testing
- [X] Create unit tests for core game logic
- [X] Test scoring system accuracy
- [X] Validate word dictionary integration
- [X] Test game progression and flow
- [ ] Test GUI functionality and responsiveness

## 💻 Optional Future Features
- [X] Add dictionary integration
- [ ] Implement save/load functionality
- [ ] Create difficulty levels
- [ ] Add achievements system
- [ ] Implement time-based challenges
- [ ] Add animations and visual effects
